The package provides functions to clean and visualize data from the
[NOAA Significant Earthquake Database](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/search).



### Dataset
The NOAA Significant Earthquake database can be made available by executing the
following

```{r}
api_uri <- "https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/hazard-service/api/v1/earthquakes"
api_uri <- "https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/hazard-service/api/v1/earthquakes"
api_uri <- "https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/hazard-service/api/v1/earthquakes"
api_uri <- "https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/hazard-service/api/v1/earthquakes"
f <- jsonlite::read_json(api_uri, simplify = TRUE)api_uri <- "https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/hazard-service/api/v1/earthquakes"
f <- jsonlite::read_json(api_uri, simplify = TRUE)
earthquakes <- dplyr::as_tibble(f$items)
```


### Cleaning
The data sourced by the API call requires cleaning as per the JHU capstone project requirements
using the function `eq_clean_data`. This function (as per requirements) returns a DF that can be
modified for accuracy.

```{r}
df <- earthquakes %>%
  eq_clean_data() %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    country %in% c("USA", "Mexico") & lubridate::year(date) >= 2000
  )
```

### Timeline
Having cleaned the data, the events can now be plotted on a timeline
with optional label annotation. Below, the timeline is plotted with a
separate axis for each country and events are colored according to the
total number of deaths. The five highest magnitude events are annotated
with their corresponding location.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(
    ggplot2::aes(x = date, y = country, colour = deathsTotal),
    alpha = 
  ) +
  geom_timeline() +
  geom_timeline_label(
    ggplot2::aes(label = locationName, magnitude = eqMagnitude),
    n_max = 5
  )
```


### Map
The sites of the events can also be plotted on an interactive map. The sites
will show a tooltip containing details when clicked. Here, the helper
function `eq_create_label` is used to create the underlying html for the
tooltip.

```{r}
df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(popup_text = eq_create_label(.)) %>%
  eq_map(annot_col = "popup_text")
```
